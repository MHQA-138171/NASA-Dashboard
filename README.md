# NASA-Dashboard
Note: The client was not created by me. I just integrated the Backend with Front-end
The NASA-Dashboard shows the upcoming and past launches of SPACE-X from 2006 onwords
The SPACE X launch data is coming from SPACE X API (https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/)
You can also schedule a new launch with required launch data. You can also abort your launch
The Launch data coming from Space X and the Client is stored in MONGO DB
